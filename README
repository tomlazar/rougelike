Charlie Morley & Tom Lazar

The current version of our "MSCS rougelike" has two levels and a room, two bad guys,
and two attacks that the player can use. We currently don't have any artwork,
but we have placeholders for most of the different environment pieces we want to have.


The game starts on the third floor of Cudahy. Look for the gold dot equipment pick-ups
to get your weapons. Both weapons require you to get some-what close to hack the bad
guys, and one of the bad guys has some defense against your attacks. 
If the evil robots touch you for too long you'll lose.


One of the equipment upgrades is in the systems lab. Tiles which bring you to new
rooms and levels are currently colored Aqua Blue.


As we go forward we plan to add lots more levels and rooms (which should be easy with 
our csv file level system), and probably at least one more bad guy type and weapon type.
We eventually want to add some story prompts as well.



Controls:
WASD for movement
The rest are explained on screen, but:
 - Point and click to select a target, hold space to hack
 - Right click to throw a hack grenade
 
Some debugging controls we left in if you want to play around with them:
 - J to spawn a junker at the mouse location.
 - Q and E to zoom in and out!
