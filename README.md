# Roomba Game

_By: Tom Lazar and Charlie Morley_

### The Game 

You play a roomba in a tough spot in order to win you must collect all the dust bunnies in the room. 
The bunnies start off with no properties but need to be collected, after a while though they build up a static charge that can recharge your battery. 
But watch out after a while the bunnies can reverse their charge so it actually reduces your battery level. 

You **WIN** if you collect all the bunnies on the field, but you can also **LOSE** if you run out of battery before the bunnies have been collected.
